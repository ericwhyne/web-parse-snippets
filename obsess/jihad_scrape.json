By taking an interdisciplinary approach of social-media analysis and cluster network assessment, we decided to start a series on Jihadica on the parts of the overall jihadi, primarily Arabic language propaganda resonating among the audiences online. We plan on delivering updates on the subject as we move along and kick-off the series with an overall introduction to the theme.\n\nIn future posts in the series, we will highlight and decipher some of the core content most often shared on Twitter, allowing conclusions to be drawn about the parts of jihadist propaganda which resonate with a wider audience (and hence shared over and over again).\n\nThe recent essay by Abu Sa\u2018d al-\u2018Amili on the state of global online jihad (discussed here) lamented a general decline in participation in jihadi online forums. Furthermore, al-\u2018Amili issued a \u201cCall (nida\u2019) to the Soldiers of the Jihadi Media\u201d demanding that they \u201creturn to their frontiers (thughur)\u201d elevating their status. Al-\u2018Amili himself is one of the high-profile clerics, a \u201cprolific \u201cInternet Shaykh\u201d (Lia) on the forums, but is also quite active on twitter (@al3aamili).\n\nTwo interrelated causes identified by Abu Sa\u2018d al-\u2018Amili were the periods when forums were offline and the migration of users to social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook. This is exacerbated by the movement of \u201cmajor [jihadi] writers and analysts\u201d (kibar al-kuttab wa-l-muhallilin) from the forums to social media platforms. This has perhaps increased the momentum of members of tier-one jihad forums to expand onto twitter while twitter as a massive communication relay has become the basis for a new generation of sympathizers, posing another intersection. Twitter is a further medium of choice to (re-) disseminate propaganda material in general and is a platform where activists, sympathizers, and actual fighters upload audiovisual and other types into the jihadi hub.\n\nJihadists have aggressively expanded the use of twitter, in addition to Facebook and YouTube, especially since the outbreak of violence in Syria. During 2011 members of Jihadist forums issued media-strategies and advisory to fellow members prior, as for example is stated in this posting here of the al-Ansar forum. The posting, initiated by the member Istishhadiyya is basically a very elemental guide, comprehensive and for beginners, highlighting the effective and fast communication capability. The same posting was copy-and-pasted by Shumukh member Basha\u2019ir shortly afterwards. A handbook, compiled by Twitter user @osamh ended up on the jihadi forums to further underline the importance of Twitter as well as its difference to Facebook, where jihadists already have a strong presence.\n\nIt took a while for jihadi activism to fully unravel on Twitter, and they have maintained a cohesive as well as detailed presence on this social media platform since the Syrian conflict turned violent in 2012.\n\nTwitter, and as such social media in general, is in the meantime an integral part of jihadists\u2019 media endeavors on the Internet, with the majority of jihadi forums having their official account advertised for on the main pages of the forums.\n\nThe role of the media activists, or in jihadist speak the \u201cmedia mujahid\u201d has since the death of Osama bin Laden in May of 2011 been promoted, highlighted and approved. AQ related documents have made this role model prominent. The role model of the \u201cmedia martyr\u201d any \u201cmedia mujahid\u201d can be become, is backed by the call to take the fight on a greater level on al channels online issued by al-Fajr in their response of the killing of bin Laden:\n\n\u201cThe Internet is a battlefield for jihad, a place for missionary work, a field of confronting the enemies of God. It is upon any individual to consider himself as a media-mujahid, dedicating himself, his wealth and his time for God.\u201d (Analysis here, Arabic original here)\n\nAt first, the strategies to promote Twitter among members of jihadi forums failed to develop substantial traction, but this changed drastically during 2012.

By rebranding and reframing the content created by civil society activists, jihadi propaganda used these grievances to support a key jihadist self-perception; the obligation to respond by force to defend and protect the Sunnites in Syria.\n\nDue to the effect and success of the Syrian based Jihadi groups, other jihadi groups as well as the main forums are adopting the twitter activism, advertising official forum accounts on the main pages with users within the forums using twitter hashtags (#) or references to twitter users (for example: @al_nukhba). A list of \u201cThe most important jihadi and support sites for jihad and the mujahideen on Twitter\u2019\u201d was recently posted on the Shumukh al-Islam forum, allowing users to identify key accounts they might wish to follow.\n\nIndividual sympathizers and all those feeling inclined to contribute to the media jihad re-disseminate authoritative files of al-Qa\u2019ida on twitter on a larger scale.

The forum administrators and media-activists also are starting to incorporate and misuse Twitter for their purposes, in coordinated attempts to virtually infiltrate legitimate social movements by using the same hash tags and a similar rhetoric to create ideological cohesion \u2013 and placing extremist views and files in that virtual sphere while claiming to fight on the ground for the sake of the people.\n\nTo analyze jihadi media networks, their sympathizers and followers we have used a combined approach focused on a unique interdisciplinary analysis of the data acquired by technical means and the subsequent and immediate analytical process of its content.\n\nUsing these methods we have asked a range of questions, how have jihadi propagandists been able to gain traction and a foothold online? How do they disseminate propaganda content to a global, multilingual audience and what resonates most with that audience?

Communities", "url": "http://online-jihad.com/", "cleaned_text": "The posting with all links is available on the jihadica blog\n\nAli Fisher and I have recently exchanged thoughts and data regarding the increasing Jihadi use of Twitter. By taking an interdisciplinary approach of social-media analysis and cluster network assessment, we decided to start a series on Jihadica on the parts of the overall jihadi, primarily Arabic language propaganda resonating among the audiences online. We plan on delivering updates on the subject as we move along and kick-off the series with an overall introduction to the theme.\n\nIn future posts in the series, we will highlight and decipher some of the core content most often shared on Twitter, allowing conclusions to be drawn about the parts of jihadist propaganda which resonate with a wider audience (and hence shared over and over again).\n\nThe recent essay by Abu Sa\u2018d al-\u2018Amili on the state of global online jihad (discussed here) lamented a general decline in participation in jihadi online forums. Furthermore, al-\u2018Amili issued a \u201cCall (nida\u2019) to the Soldiers of the Jihadi Media\u201d demanding that they \u201creturn to their frontiers (thughur)\u201d elevating their status. Al-\u2018Amili himself is one of the high-profile clerics, a \u201cprolific \u201cInternet Shaykh\u201d (Lia) on the forums, but is also quite active on twitter (@al3aamili).\n\nTwo interrelated causes identified by Abu Sa\u2018d al-\u2018Amili were the periods when forums were offline and the migration of users to social networking sites such as Twitter and Facebook. This is exacerbated by the movement of \u201cmajor [jihadi] writers and analysts\u201d (kibar al-kuttab wa-l-muhallilin) from the forums to social media platforms. This has perhaps increased the momentum of members of tier-one jihad forums to expand onto twitter while twitter as a massive communication relay has become the basis for a new generation of sympathizers, posing another intersection. Twitter is a further medium of choice to (re-) disseminate propaganda material in general and is a platform where activists, sympathizers, and actual fighters upload audiovisual and other types into the jihadi hub.\n\nJihadists have aggressively expanded the use of twitter, in addition to Facebook and YouTube, especially since the outbreak of violence in Syria. During 2011 members of Jihadist forums issued media-strategies and advisory to fellow members prior, as for example is stated in this posting here of the al-Ansar forum. The posting, initiated by the member Istishhadiyya is basically a very elemental guide, comprehensive and for beginners, highlighting the effective and fast communication capability. The same posting was copy-and-pasted by Shumukh member Basha\u2019ir shortly afterwards. A handbook, compiled by Twitter user @osamh ended up on the jihadi forums to further underline the importance of Twitter as well as its difference to Facebook, where jihadists already have a strong presence.\n\nIt took a while for jihadi activism to fully unravel on Twitter, and they have maintained a cohesive as well as detailed presence on this social media platform since the Syrian conflict turned violent in 2012.\n\nTwitter, and as such social media in general, is in the meantime an integral part of jihadists\u2019 media endeavors on the Internet, with the majority of jihadi forums having their official account advertised for on the main pages of the forums.\n\nThe role of the media activists, or in jihadist speak the \u201cmedia mujahid\u201d has since the death of Osama bin Laden in May of 2011 been promoted, highlighted and approved. AQ related documents have made this role model prominent. The role model of the \u201cmedia martyr\u201d any \u201cmedia mujahid\u201d can be become, is backed by the call to take the fight on a greater level on al channels online issued by al-Fajr in their response of the killing of bin Laden:\n\n\u201cThe Internet is a battlefield for jihad, a place for missionary work, a field of confronting the enemies of God. It is upon any individual to consider himself as a media-mujahid, dedicating himself, his wealth and his time for God.\u201d (Analysis here, Arabic original here)\n\nAt first, the strategies to promote Twitter among members of jihadi forums failed to develop substantial traction, but this changed drastically during 2012. When jihadists in and outside of Syria started to use and incorporate twitter as a medium to disseminate and re-post al-Qa\u2019ida and other propaganda material.\n\nAt first Syrian non-violent activists used, and continue to use, twitter as a medium to document human rights abuse and war crimes of the Assad regime, but jihadists quickly adapted that content and the platform for their propaganda.\n\nSocial-media smart and professional jihadists adopted this treasure grove for their propaganda. By rebranding and reframing the content created by civil society activists, jihadi propaganda used these grievances to support a key jihadist self-perception; the obligation to respond by force to defend and protect the Sunnites in Syria.\n\nDue to the effect and success of the Syrian based Jihadi groups, other jihadi groups as well as the main forums are adopting the twitter activism, advertising official forum accounts on the main pages with users within the forums using twitter hashtags (#) or references to twitter users (for example: @al_nukhba). A list of \u201cThe most important jihadi and support sites for jihad and the mujahideen on Twitter\u2019\u201d was recently posted on the Shumukh al-Islam forum, allowing users to identify key accounts they might wish to follow.\n\nIndividual sympathizers and all those feeling inclined to contribute to the media jihad re-disseminate authoritative files of al-Qa\u2019ida on twitter on a larger scale. Now all major jihadi media departments, part of militant networks, have their own channels on Twitter, linking to content from the jihadi forums and other social media platforms, primarily YouTube, Facebook, and pictures in general.\n\nTwitter has turned into a primary hub for the distribution of jihadi agitprop files. These Jihadi information sharing networks using Twitter coexist, autonomously, with the classical forums. These networks carry, for example, samples of the wide range of jihadi propaganda files, in some cases placed first on Twitter, posted via mobile phones from the front lines. As a brief overview, a few samples consisting of:\n\nWhat are they sharing?\n\nIn addition to disseminating their own propaganda, jihadi media activists repurpose content from social movements and non-jihadi groups for their own purposes, framing the non-jihadi actions or demonstrations as part of the global militant struggle. This has created another \u2018grey area\u2019 where analysts have to carefully monitor and decipher such content. The forum administrators and media-activists also are starting to incorporate and misuse Twitter for their purposes, in coordinated attempts to virtually infiltrate legitimate social movements by using the same hash tags and a similar rhetoric to create ideological cohesion \u2013 and placing extremist views and files in that virtual sphere while claiming to fight on the ground for the sake of the people.\n\nTo analyze jihadi media networks, their sympathizers and followers we have used a combined approach focused on a unique interdisciplinary analysis of the data acquired by technical means and the subsequent and immediate analytical process of its content.\n\nUsing these methods we have asked a range of questions, how have jihadi propagandists been able to gain traction and a foothold online? How do they disseminate propaganda content to a global, multilingual audience and what resonates most with that audience? What are the networks through which their content flows and what are the different roles users play within these networks? Ultimately do the different jihadi twitter accounts reach a range of different communities, or is it a small densely interconnected echo chamber?", "stanford_title_entities": [], "page_links":
