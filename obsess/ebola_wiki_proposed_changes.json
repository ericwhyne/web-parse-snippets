We also raise a number of considerations regarding the role of amniocentesis and induced delivery in the management of pregnant women with EVD.Initial presentationAt the beginning of June 2014, a woman in her late 20s at seven months gestation presented at the Ebola treatment centre in Gu\ufffd\ufffdkedou, Guinea, with a history of seven days of asthenia, fever (self-reported), and vomiting. For this reason, a vaginal delivery was arranged to take place in the high-risk zone of the EVD treatment centre. In the second case, an emergency delivery was required and performed at the EVD treatment centre after the patient was found in shock, with intra-vaginal fetal head.\n\n"}, {"name": "III FGM", "mwaccount": {"username": "robot", "password": "UtLwnEDZ", "sitepath": "/", "site": "ebola-wiki.com"}, "create": "[[category:organizations]]\n", "unique_attrib": "http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20983", "type": "ORGANIZATION", "append": "\n\n\nEurosurveillance\n* http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20983\n* Summary: This delivery also took place in the high-risk zone of the centre and episiotomy was justified due to the grade III FGM.\n\n"}, {"name": "EBV", "type": "ORGANIZATION", "create": "[[category:organizations]]\n", "unique_attrib": "http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20983", "mwaccount": {"username": "robot", "password": "UtLwnEDZ", "sitepath": "/", "site": "ebola-wiki.com"}, "append": "\n\n\nEurosurveillance\n* http://www.eurosurveillance.org/ViewArticle.aspx?ArticleId=20983\n* Summary: The Ebola virus (EBV) test (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)) was positive.Clinical course and managementOn the same day (day 0), the woman was admitted to the EBV treatment/isolation unit where she immediately started receiving supportive treatment, including Ringer\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds lactate, antipyretics, ceftriaxone (2 g/day), metoclopramide and omeprazole.
