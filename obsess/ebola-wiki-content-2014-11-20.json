That is the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms. During this time, viral genomes are replicating and the host is responding, producing cytokines such as interferon that can have global effects, leading to the classical symptoms of an acute infection<ref>http://www.virology.ws/2014/10/08/the-incubation-period-of-a-viral-infection/</ref>\n\nHowever, studies have shown that this number may not in fact be correct.\n\n== Longer Incubation Periods ==\n\nGroups such as The National Institute of Health, the New England Journal of Medicine, and PLOS Currents have all show than Ebola can incubate for longer than the previously state CDC and WHO claims of 21 days.\n\n=== The National Institute of Health ===\n \nThe National Institute of Health analyzed data collected during the Ebola outbreak (subtype Zaire) in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the Congo, in 1995 using maximum likelihood inference and assuming a log-normally distributed incubation period. The mean incubation period was estimated to be 12.7 days (standard deviation 4.31 days), indicating that about 4.1% of patients may have incubation periods longer than 21 days. The NHI concluded that if the risk of new cases is to be reduced to 1% then 25 days should be used when investigating the source of an outbreak, when determining the duration of surveillance for contacts, and when declaring the end of an outbreak.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3766904/</ref>\n\n=== The World Health Organization ===\n\nRecent studies conducted in West Africa have demonstrated that 95% of confirmed cases have an incubation period in the range of 1 to 21 days; 98% have an incubation period that falls within the 1 to 42 day interval. WHO is therefore confident that detection of no new cases, with active surveillance in place, throughout this 42-day period means that an Ebola outbreak is indeed over.<ref>http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/ebola/14-october-2014/en/</ref>\n\n=== The New England Journal of Medicine===\n  \nThe mean incubation period was 11.4 days. Time between Exposure and Disease Onset, and did not vary by country. Approximately 95% of the case patients had symptom onset within 21 days after exposure, which is the recommended period for follow-up of contacts.

A current review of previous outbreaks cites the same range . The precise origin of this assessment is unclear, however it is possibly based on the study of the either the 1976 Zaire outbreak11 or 2000 Uganda outbreak both of which reported (without detailed analysis) a maximum observed incubation time of 21 days.<ref>http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/on-the-quarantine-period-for-ebola-virus/#ref17</ref>\n\nAt a 21 day quarantine period, using the data sets other than the Congo analysis of Chowell, three Congo data analyses, the probability of exceedance is between 1.9 and 12%. In other words from 0.1 to 12% of the time, an individual case will have a greater incubation time than 21 days. The 0.1% stems from the 1976 Zaire outbreak, which has the fewest cases analyzed than any of the others in Figure 2.\nIf the estimated incubation time distributions for the Congo outbreak (Figure 2) are used, this would suggest a quarantine time of as high as 31 days. <ref>http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/on-the-quarantine-period-for-ebola-virus/#ref17</ref>\n\n\n\n[[File:Longincubation.png|frameless|600px|Source: [http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/on-the-quarantine-period-for-ebola-virus/#ref17 PLOS Currents - FIGURE 2.

It is usually accompanied by early production of infectious virions and elimination of infection by the host immune system. Acute viral infections are typically observed with pathogens such as influenza virus and rhinovirus. Ebola hemorrhagic fever is an acute viral infection, although the course of disease is unusually severe.\n\nOften an acute infection may cause little or no clinical symptoms \u2013 the so-called inapparent infection. A well-known example is poliovirus infection: over 90% are without symptoms. During an inapparent infection, sufficient virus replication occurs in the host to induce antiviral antibodies, but not enough to cause disease. Such infections are important for the spread of infection, because they are not easily detected.\n<ref>http://www.virology.ws/2009/02/13/acute-viral-infections/</ref>\n\n\n== Infection without Symptoms ==\n\nThe CDC's guidelines for testing for Ebola requires that suspected patients have a temperature is at least 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit (or 38.6 degrees Celsius.)<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/pdf/ebola-algorithm.pdf</ref> If the fever is below this and there are no visible symptoms of Ebola, health authorities say it should be assumed the person is not infectious.\n\nOn October 12, 2014 David Willman of the LA Times wrote an article highlighting a discrepency found by the New England Journal of Medicine.<ref>http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-1012-ebola-fever-20141012-story.html#page=1</ref>, <ref>http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1411100</ref>\n\n\"Yet the largest study of the current outbreak found that in nearly 13% of \"confirmed and probable\" cases in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and elsewhere, those infected did not have fevers.

It uses the very cells that are meant to fight infection to travel to other parts of the body, including the liver, spleen, kidneys, and brain. It attacks almost every organ and tissue. The particle explosion also sets off an overwhelming inflammatory reaction. That\u2019s what causes the sudden flu-like symptoms that are the first signs of ebola. Inside the blood vessels, the virus causes abnormal clotting and bleeding at the same time. Bleeding into the skin causes a red rash that appears all over. With the ability to clot normally destroyed, bleeding occurs internally as well as from the eyes, ears, and nose. This whole cascade of events causes the organs to fail.

See the Visov Map.\n\nJuly 11, Cedric Moro created a new Map to monitor suspected cases. \n\nhttp://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2014_West_Africa_Ebola_Response\n\nhttp://hot.openstreetmap.org/\n\nhttp://hot.openstreetmap.org/projects/west_africa_ebola_epidemic\n\n== Data ==\nhttp://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/2014_West_Africa_Ebola_Response#Exporting_OpenStreetMap_data\n\n\n[[Category:maps]]\n[[Category:informational]]\n[[Category:data]]\n[[Category:tools]]", "title": "Openstreetmap HOT"}, {"text": "http://www.cartong.org\n\nNGO Overview\n\nFounded in 2006, CartONG is a French non-governmental organisation committed to furthering the use of geographic information systems (GIS) to improve data gathering and analysis for emergency relief and development programmes around the world.\n\nNew technologies including smart phones, GPS locator systems and specific software can be used to bring together vital information about people's needs as never before. From determining the locations and health of people trapped under buildings after an earthquake, to tracking the number of petty crimes in an urban slum, up-to-date and geographically specific information helps save lives and improves the lives of people in the community. To find out more about how GIS is used around the world to improve people's lives, see this list of CartONG projects and services.\n\nCartONG enables emergency relief and development organizations and local governments to manage their own existing data, integrate other data sources and then use that data to plan programmes and monitor progress and impact. In our work, we focus on listening closely to the needs of the community, as well as training local people. This ensures that projects are sustainable and tailored to the needs and priorities of the people we are seeking to assist.\n\nCartONG is a registered non-profit organisation headquartered in Chamb\u00e9ry, France under registration number 490 816 345 00022.\n\n[[Category:tools]]\n[[Category:maps]]", "title": "CartONG"}, {"text": "\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

We used probabilities, drawn from reports of previous EVD outbreaks, to model the daily movement of patients between and within the various disease categories (i.e., susceptible, incubation, infectious, revocery/death).\n\nType of Model: Susceptibile, Incubation, Infectious, Recovery (SIIR) Model.\n\nLanguage:\neng \n\n\n== Controversy ==\nA user on reddir.com/r/ebola demonstrated how innacurate the spreadsheet can be by showing results generated by different starting parameters:\n\"This is fiddling with the patient isolation parameters (bar chart at the bottom), holding all other values at their defaults.

Starting Monday, anyone arriving in the U.S. from Mali will undergo the same screening procedures that were ordered last month for travelers from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The CDC is quickly expanding its staffing in Mali, with at least four people there as of Sunday and about a dozen expected to be in place within the next couple of days, CDC officials said.

Last week an epidemiological presentation showed Mali had two suspected cases of the disease, which has killed at least 4,951 people, mostly in Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea in the worst outbreak of the virus since it was identified in 1976.\n\nWHO experts say that the best way to tackle the disease is to stop it in its tracks before it can spread, and finding contacts of the initial patient is crucial. If other travelers caught the disease, their onward journeys risk spreading it in the capital Bamako or deeper into Mali, which borders Niger, Algeria, Senegal, Mauritania, Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast.\n* Source: [[reuters.com]] \n* [http://reddit.com/r/EbolaWestAfrica/comments/2l9dr4/who_mali_update_currently_no_ebola_cases_108/ Discus on Reddit]\n\n\n\n\nMali: Ebola Situation Report #23 dated Nov 16\n* http://www.sante.gov.ml/docs/MALI%20-%20EVD-%20Sitrep%2016%20Novembre%202014_22h12.pdf\n* Summary: \n* Source: [[sante.gov.ml]] \n* [http://reddit.com/r/EbolaWestAfrica/comments/2ml9ny/mali_ebola_situation_report_23_dated_nov_16/ Discus on Reddit]\n\n\n\n\nFearing Ebola surge, Mali widens virus watch to 440 people\n* http://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-2837790/Mali-places-hundreds-watch-bid-stem-Ebola.html\n* Summary: Officials in Mali met to consider increasing security at its border following two confirmed cases of Ebola due to infection in neighbouring Guinea.

The guidance also states that although 5 \u00b5m (Micrometers) has traditionally been defined as the particle size break point distinguishing between larger particles (droplet transmission) and smaller particles (airborne transmission), observations of particle dynamics have demonstrated that a range of droplet sizes, including those with diameters of 30 \u03bcm or greater, can remain suspended in the air. Influenza virus is an example of a pathogen transmitted by the droplet route.\n\nThe HICPAC guidance defines airborne transmission as dissemination of either airborne droplet nuclei or small particles in the respirable size range containing infectious agents that remain infective over time and distance. It states that microorganisms carried in this manner may be dispersed over long distances by air currents and may be inhaled by susceptible individuals who have not had face-to-face contact with (or been in the same room with) the infectious individual.\n\nFurthermore, preventing the spread of pathogens by the airborne route requires the use of special air handling and ventilation systems, such as airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) to contain and then safely remove the infectious agents. In addition to AIIRs, respiratory protection with a NIOSH-certified N95 or higher level respirator is recommended for HCP entering the AIIR to prevent acquisition of airborne infectious agents. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is cited as an example of a pathogen transmitted by the airborne route.\n\nIn spite of the distinction made between droplet and airborne transmission, current knowledge of aerosols indicates that there is no clear line differentiating droplet and airborne transmission, as currently defined, on the basis of particle size. Coughing, sneezing, talking, exhalation, and certain medical procedures generate respiratory particles in a wide range of sizes -- not just very large droplets that launch directly to the mucosal surfaces or drop to the floor. In addition, particles begin to evaporate and become smaller immediately upon emission, and particles ranging from very small up to 100 \u03bcm can be inhaled by persons in the near vicinity of the source. <ref>http://img.medscape.com/article/741/245/741245-figure.jpg</ref>\n\nIn the current infection control paradigm, airborne transmission is synonymous with long-range transmission of pathogens that can be inhaled and require special air handling to contain. This contrasts with droplet transmission, in which infectious particles are thought to be deposited on a mucous membrane, are not inhaled, and do not require special air handling. However, the association of droplet exposure with infection is confounded by inhalation exposure because close contact with infectious people permits droplet exposure but also maximizes inhalation exposure. Therefore, it is incorrect to conclude that because long-range transmission of infection is not observed, a pathogen is transmitted only by the droplet route.\n\nAbsence of long-range transmission, as demonstrated for tuberculosis and measles, does not mean that a pathogen cannot be transmitted by inhalation. As currently defined, the terms \"droplet\" and \"airborne transmission\" are inadequate to describe aerosol transmission by inhalation at short range.\n<ref>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/741245_3</ref>\n\n== Blood ==\n\nAt the peak of illness, an Ebola patient can have 10 billion viral particles in one-fifth of a teaspoon of blood. That compares with 50,000 to 100,000 particles in an untreated H.I.V. patient, and five million to 20 million in someone with untreated hepatitis C. <ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/us/questions-rise-on-preparations-at-hospitals-to-deal-with-ebola.html?_r=1</ref>\n\n== Dogs ==\nDuring the 2001-2002 outbreak in Gabon, [the NHI] observed that several dogs were highly exposed to Ebola virus by eating infected dead animals. To examine whether these animals became infected with Ebola virus, [the NHI] sampled 439 dogs and screened them by Ebola virus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G assay, antigen detection, and viral polymerase chain reaction amplification. Seven (8.9%) of 79 samples from the 2 main towns, 15 (15.2%) of 99 samples from Mekambo, and 40 (25.2%) of 159 samples from villages in the Ebola virus-epidemic area had detectable Ebola virus-IgG, compared to only 2 (2%) of 102 samples from France. Among dogs from villages with both infected animal carcasses and human cases, seroprevalence was 31.8%. A significant positive direct association existed between seroprevalence and the distances to the Ebola virus-epidemic area. This study suggests that dogs can be infected by Ebola virus and that the putative infection is asymptomatic. <ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15757552</ref> However, the CDC reports no current reports of dogs or cats becoming sick with Ebola. <ref>http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/transmission/qas-pets.html</ref> The World Small Animal Veterinary Assn. recommends that pets exposed to Ebola be quarantined and tested. <ref>http://www.wsava.org/article/ebola-and-dogs</ref>\n\n== Wildlife-to-Human ==\nEbola can infect mammals and likely first spread to humans from bats in rural Africa. <ref>http://time.com/3480961/ebola-animals-transmission/</ref>\n\nIt is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural Ebola virus hosts. Ebola is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest. <ref>http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/</ref>\n\nBush meat is also a source of transmission from animal to human. Consuming the raw meat of infected bats, apes and/or monkeys can lead to wildlife-to-human Transmission. Animals should be handled with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing. Animal products (blood and meat) should be thoroughly cooked before consumption\n<ref>http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/</ref>\n\nDuring the 2001-2002 outbreak in Gabon, [it was ]observed that several dogs were highly exposed to Ebola virus by eating infected dead animals.

Report reaching the Sierra Leone Telegraph from Freetown, says that local Sierra Leonean doctors in Freetown who are working on developing a new treatment for Ebola, based on blood transfusion \u2013 using the serum of recovered Ebola patient, have been treating Dr. Salia before travelling to the USA last Saturday. And as the world waits for a vaccine to be developed and manufactured in sufficient quantity and at affordable cost, the people of Sierra Leone in the meantime continue to count with horror, the growing number of new Ebola cases that are mushrooming all over the country, particular in the capital Freetown and the northern districts.\n* Source: [[thesierraleonetelegraph.com]] \n*

GCHope\u2019s partner on the ground, Kingdom Care Medical Center serving in Monrovia, Liberia, has asked for sanitation supplies. These supplies are crucial to help treat those suffering from the illness as well as protect the medical professionals treating patients. Ebola spreads through contact with infected organs and bodily fluids including blood, saliva, and urine. There is no known cure for Ebola, so it is vital that the doctors and patients exposed to the disease take every precaution in order to prevent further spread of this incurable disease.

Real-time monitoring, complex multipath surveys, monitoring, and detailed analysis can readily be conducted. Further, Interactive Voice Response (IVR) mLearning approaches will take knowledge delivery one step beyond SMS with higher content limits, while also addressing literacy and language divides through spoken language.

The Anglican Diocese of Bo has reached  an estimated 150,000 people, which constitutes the general populace of the five districts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(3) Provision of sanitary supplies (e.g. chlorine, buckets with taps, detergents, gloves, sanitizers, masks and bowls) to quarantined communities from the five districts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(4) Distribution of food items (e.g. oil, rice, canned fish and meat) in preparation for the three-day country-wide lockdown to a total of 978 families (out of which 205 are women headed families, 161 survivor families, 28 child headed families and 584 destitute families (i.e. the sick and the elderly)).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(5) Distribution of medical equipment and sanitary materials from Episcopal Relief &amp; Development\u2019s Ghana Regional Office have been shipped on two occasions to health facilities in Bo. \n\n\nThe key strengths of Episcopal Relief &amp; Development's Ebola response program are:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(1) The Church's widespread infrastructure and networks: They cover major towns and reach the remotest villages. This network is used to get key messages across to a wider population and to provide much needed assistance, such as basic sanitary and hygiene supplies, protective equipment and food, to affected communities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2) Church leaders' high esteem and respect among communities: They are  listened to, especially during times of crisis. They can build upon the trust and confidence they have with their respective communities to incite positive change and reduce risky behavior and practices. The government has also recognized this level of respect, and have invited both dioceses to sit on the respective government-led response mechanisms, thereby providing access, visibility and authority in high-level decision making bodies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(3) Strong partnerships with government and civil society organizations:  Our partners are members of the government-led task force units established at national and district levels, enabling them to contribute to the overall effort by sharing information and knowledge and responding in a coordinated, cost-effective manner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(4) Large, dedicated and skilled volunteer workforce: This includes community malaria agents, priests, women\u2019s micro-savings group leaders, farm group members and others that are major stakeholders in our integrated development programs and who are also key mobilizers in the fight against Ebola.\n\n==See Also==\n[[List of NGO activities]]\n\n[[category:informational]]\n[[category:ngo]]", "title": "Episcopal Relief and Development"}, {"text": "==Disclaimer==\n===Ebola Wiki MAKES NO GUARANTEE OF VALIDITY===\n\nThis is an online open-content collaborative encyclopedia; that is, a voluntary association of individuals and groups working to develop a common resource of human knowledge.

Ebola is contagious when a patient has symptoms, meaning the girl who died may have been infectious throughout her long and broken journey from Guinea, where controls are supposed to be in place to screen people for Ebola symptoms before they cross the border.

Since 1998, the organization has coordinated the distribution of food and other lifesaving aid to children and families in countries all over the world.\n\nStop Hunger Now created its meal packaging program, in 2005. The program perfected the assembly process that combines rice, soy, dehydrated vegetables and a flavoring mix including 21 essential vitamins and minerals into small meal packets. Each meal costs only 29 cents. The food stores easily, has a shelf-life of two years and transports quickly. Stop Hunger Now works with international partners that ship and distribute the meals in-country.\n\nThe packaging operation is mobile enough to go wherever volunteers are located, and can be adapted to accommodate as few as 25 and as many as 500 volunteers at a time. One SHN packaging event can result in the packaging of more than 1,000,000 meals. The use of volunteers for product packaging has resulted in an extremely cost-effective operation while, at the same time, increasing awareness of global hunger and food insecurity issues across the world.\n\nStop Hunger Now provides over 70% of its meals to support transformational development programs such as school feeding programs, vocational training programs, early childhood development programs, orphanages, and medical clinics.  Working with these programs helps enhance lives by giving beneficiaries the opportunity to break the cycle of poverty through education,  skills development, and health care while also receiving much needed nutrition.  Stop Hunger Now\u2019s goal is to allocate 80% of its meals to transformational development programs by 2015.\n\nEvery year Stop Hunger Now reserves 10% of its projected meals to respond right away to crisis situations including natural disasters, conflict and famine.   In addition to providing food for crisis relief, Stop Hunger also works to meet the immediate needs of those suffering from hunger.\n\nStop Hunger Now's meal packaging program operations throughout the US and internationally.  \n\n\n==See Also==\n[[List of NGO activities]]\n\n[[category:informational]]\n[[category:ngo]]", "title": "Stop Hunger Now"}, {"text": "http://www.lifeusa.org\n\nLife for Relief and Development is a non-profit humanitarian charity founded in 1992 by concerned Arab American professionals in response to the humanitarian crises that developed in Iraq as a result of the 1991 Gulf War.\n\nIraqi GirlToday, Life for Relief and Development has become the largest U.S.-founded Arab American humanitarian relief and development organization.

Ultimately, the people best suited to decide what a community needs are the people of the community itself.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control projects the disease could infect as many as 1.4 million people by January 2014, killing up to 70% of those infected, and potentially becoming endemic in West Africa.\n\nBut there is hope. Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) currently runs five Ebola-management centers with 2000 staff. These courageous individuals are helping stem the tide, but more are urgently needed. The World Health Organization says a 20-fold increase in health care workers is necessary to bring the outbreak under control. The only way that will happen is with support from people like us.\n\nHow It Works\nA Day Without Touch raises much needed funds for MSF while simultaneously raising awareness of the the way Ebola \u201cparasitizes\u201d humanity, using our most human impulses--to touch and care for those who are sick and in need--to propogate disease. Participants are challenged to go for as long as they can without direct skin-to-skin contact while sharing their experiences with friends and family through social media.

In Monrovia, though, ordinary life is resuming and there are some signs of normalcy that were all but absent during the height of the crisis here.\n* Source: [[hosted.ap.org]] \n* [http://reddit.com/r/EbolaNewsBot/comments/2mnnko/liberian_couples_marry_a_sign_of_less_ebola_fear/ Discus on Reddit]", "title": "MONROVIA"}, {"text": "[[category:people]]\n\n\n==Recent News==\n\n\n\n\nSierra Leone imprisons journalist under emergency Ebola measures\n* http://reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0IO26520141104?irpc=932\n* Summary: David Tam-Baryoh was sent to the Pademba Road prison on an executive order from the president, according to Chief Superintendent Ibrahim Koroma.\n* Source: [[reuters.com]]\n* [http://reddit.com/r/EbolaWestAfrica/comments/2ld3al/sierra_leone_imprisons_journalist_under_emergency/ Discus on Reddit]", "title": "Ibrahim Koroma"}, {"text": "[[category:locations]]\nView in google maps: http://maps.google.com/?q=Pademba+Road\n\n\n==Recent News==\n\n\n\n\nSierra Leone imprisons journalist under emergency Ebola measures\n* http://reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0IO26520141104?irpc=932\n* Summary: David Tam-Baryoh was sent to the Pademba Road prison on an executive order from the president, according to Chief Superintendent Ibrahim Koroma.\n* Source: [[reuters.com]] \n* [http://reddit.com/r/EbolaWestAfrica/comments/2ld3al/sierra_leone_imprisons_journalist_under_emergency/ Discus on Reddit]", "title": "Pademba Road"}, {"text": "[[category:people]]\n\n\n==Recent News==\n\n\nUS soldiers' Ebola quarantine in Italy causes alarm\n* http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/World/2014/Oct-29/275772-us-soldiers-ebola-quarantine-in-italy-causes-alarm.ashx\n* Summary: The commander of the US military mission in Liberia, Major General Darryl Williams, began 21 days of isolation at the base in Vicenza along with 11 other members of his staff after returning from west Africa this week.\n* Source: [[dailystar.com.lb]]\n* [http://reddit.com/r/ebolasurvival/comments/2kogfq/us_soldiers_ebola_quarantine_in_italy_causes_alarm/ Discus on Reddit]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObama sees different Ebola rules for U.S. military than for civilians\n* http://news.yahoo.com/pentagon-eyes-strict-monitoring-troops-returning-ebola-effort-183956378.html\n* Summary: The Pentagon said on Monday that Major General Darryl Williams, commander of U.S. Army Africa, and 11 of his staff were put in isolation for 21 days of monitoring after returning from West Africa to their home base in Vicenza in northeastern Italy.\n* Source: [[news.yahoo.com]]\n* [http://reddit.com/r/ebolasurvival/comments/2ksjk3/obama_sees_different_ebola_rules_for_us_military/ Discus on Reddit]", "title": "Darryl Williams"}, {"text": "[[category:organizations]]\n\n\n==Recent News==\n\n\n\n\nObama sees different Ebola rules for U.S. military than for civilians\n* http://news.yahoo.com/pentagon-eyes-strict-monitoring-troops-returning-ebola-effort-183956378.html\n* Summary: The Pentagon said on Monday that Major General Darryl Williams, commander of U.S. Army Africa, and 11 of his staff were put in isolation for 21 days of monitoring after returning from West Africa to their home base in Vicenza in northeastern Italy.\n* Source: [[news.yahoo.com]] \n* [http://reddit.com/r/ebolasurvival/comments/2ksjk3/obama_sees_different_ebola_rules_for_us_military/ Discus on Reddit]", "title": "US Army Africa"}, {"text": "[[category:people]]\n\n\n==Recent News==\n\n\n\n\nDoctor hesitates, then returns to Ebola front line\n* http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AF_EBOLA_VOLUNTEER_DOCTOR?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT\n* Summary: JOHANNESBURG (AP) -- Returning last month to Sierra Leone to treat Ebola victims after a break, volunteer doctor Juli Switala was shocked to see the obituaries and photographs of colleagues who had died of the disease in her absence, pinned to a board in the treatment center.\n* Source: [[hosted.ap.org]]\n* [http://reddit.com/r/EbolaNewsBot/comments/2moajt/doctor_hesitates_then_returns_to_ebola_front_line/ Discus on Reddit]", "title": "Juli Switala"}, {"text": "[[category:people]]\n\n\n==Recent News==\n\n\n\n\nDoctor hesitates, then returns to Ebola front line\n* http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/A/AF_EBOLA_VOLUNTEER_DOCTOR?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT\n* Summary: \"That was quite terrible, to realize that people you met a few weeks ago, who were happy, helping you with this fight, have now died because of what they were treating,\" Switala, a South African who works for Doctors Without Borders, told The Associated Press in a telephone interview from Sierra Leone.

The ruler, arithmetically unaware, quickly accepted the inventor's offer, even getting offended by his perceived notion that the inventor was asking for such a low price, and ordered the treasurer to count and hand over the wheat to the inventor. However, when the treasurer took more than a week to calculate the amount of wheat, the ruler asked him for a reason for his tardiness. The treasurer then gave him the result of the calculation, and explained that it would take more than all the assets of the kingdom to give the inventor the reward.

The Obama administration has been seeking to dissuade U.S. states from imposing quarantines on doctors, nurses and other health workers returning from West Africa and has resisted political pressure to impose travel bans on people coming from the affected area.
