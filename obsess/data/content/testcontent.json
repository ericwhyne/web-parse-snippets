That is the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms. During this time, viral genomes are replicating and the host is responding, producing cytokines such as interferon that can have global effects, leading to the classical symptoms of an acute infection<ref>http://www.virology.ws/2014/10/08/the-incubation-period-of-a-viral-infection/</ref>\n\nHowever, studies have shown that this number may not in fact be correct.\n\n== Longer Incubation Periods ==\n\nGroups such as The National Institute of Health, the New England Journal of Medicine, and PLOS Currents have all show than Ebola can incubate for longer than the previously state CDC and WHO claims of 21 days.\n\n=== The National Institute of Health ===\n \nThe National Institute of Health analyzed data collected during the Ebola outbreak (subtype Zaire) in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the Congo, in 1995 using maximum likelihood inference and assuming a log-normally distributed incubation period. The mean incubation period was estimated to be 12.7 days (standard deviation 4.31 days), indicating that about 4.1% of patients may have incubation periods longer than 21 days. The NHI concluded that if the risk of new cases is to be reduced to 1% then 25 days should be used when investigating the source of an outbreak, when determining the duration of surveillance for contacts, and when declaring the end of an outbreak.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3766904/</ref>\n\n=== The World Health Organization ===\n\nRecent studies conducted in West Africa have demonstrated that 95% of confirmed cases have an incubation period in the range of 1 to 21 days; 98% have an incubation period that falls within the 1 to 42 day interval. WHO is therefore confident that detection of no new cases, with active surveillance in place, throughout this 42-day period means that an Ebola outbreak is indeed over.<ref>http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/ebola/14-october-2014/en/</ref>\n\n=== The New England Journal of Medicine===\n  \nThe mean incubation period was 11.4 days. Time between Exposure and Disease Onset, and did not vary by country. Approximately 95% of the case patients had symptom onset within 21 days after exposure, which is the recommended period for follow-up of contacts. The estimated mean (\u00b1SD) serial interval was 15.3\u00b19.3 days, which is the same as the estimated mean generation time (see Supplementary Appendix 1)<ref>http://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa1411100/suppl_file/nejmoa1411100_appendix1.pdf</ref>.\n\nThe measured duration of the incubation period, and its variation, imply that the advice to follow case contacts for 21 days is appropriate.

A current review of previous outbreaks cites the same range . The precise origin of this assessment is unclear, however it is possibly based on the study of the either the 1976 Zaire outbreak11 or 2000 Uganda outbreak both of which reported (without detailed analysis) a maximum observed incubation time of 21 days.<ref>http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/on-the-quarantine-period-for-ebola-virus/#ref17</ref>\n\nAt a 21 day quarantine period, using the data sets other than the Congo analysis of Chowell, three Congo data analyses, the probability of exceedance is between 1.9 and 12%. In other words from 0.1 to 12% of the time, an individual case will have a greater incubation time than 21 days. The 0.1% stems from the 1976 Zaire outbreak, which has the fewest cases analyzed than any of the others in Figure 2.\nIf the estimated incubation time distributions for the Congo outbreak (Figure 2) are used, this would suggest a quarantine time of as high as 31 days. <ref>http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/on-the-quarantine-period-for-ebola-virus/#ref17</ref>\n\n\n\n[[File:Longincubation.png|frameless|600px|Source: [http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/on-the-quarantine-period-for-ebola-virus/#ref17 PLOS Currents - FIGURE 2.

The particle explosion also sets off an overwhelming inflammatory reaction. That\u2019s what causes the sudden flu-like symptoms that are the first signs of ebola.

The timeline of 300 days is longer than most of the previously recorded outbreaks of EVD or Marburg Virus Disease.\n\nModel Description: Estimate the daily movement of patients using disease probabilities for three (3) different categories of isolation: Hospitalization, Home Isolation, and No Home Isolation. We used probabilities, drawn from reports of previous EVD outbreaks, to model the daily movement of patients between and within the various disease categories (i.e., susceptible, incubation, infectious, revocery/death).\n\nType of Model: Susceptibile, Incubation, Infectious, Recovery (SIIR) Model.\n\nLanguage:\neng \n\n\n== Controversy ==\nA user on reddir.com/r/ebola demonstrated how innacurate the spreadsheet can be by showing results generated by different starting parameters:\n\"This is fiddling with the patient isolation parameters (bar chart at the bottom), holding all other values at their defaults.
