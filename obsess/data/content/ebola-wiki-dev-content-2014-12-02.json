That is the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms. During this time, viral genomes are replicating and the host is responding, producing cytokines such as interferon that can have global effects, leading to the classical symptoms of an acute infection<ref>http://www.virology.ws/2014/10/08/the-incubation-period-of-a-viral-infection/</ref>\n\nHowever, studies have shown that this number may not in fact be correct.\n\n== Longer Incubation Periods ==\n\nGroups such as The National Institute of Health, the New England Journal of Medicine, and PLOS Currents have all show than Ebola can incubate for longer than the previously state CDC and WHO claims of 21 days.\n\n=== The National Institute of Health ===\n \nThe National Institute of Health analyzed data collected during the Ebola outbreak (subtype Zaire) in Kikwit, Democratic Republic of the Congo, in 1995 using maximum likelihood inference and assuming a log-normally distributed incubation period. The mean incubation period was estimated to be 12.7 days (standard deviation 4.31 days), indicating that about 4.1% of patients may have incubation periods longer than 21 days. The NHI concluded that if the risk of new cases is to be reduced to 1% then 25 days should be used when investigating the source of an outbreak, when determining the duration of surveillance for contacts, and when declaring the end of an outbreak.<ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3766904/</ref>\n\n=== The World Health Organization ===\n\nRecent studies conducted in West Africa have demonstrated that 95% of confirmed cases have an incubation period in the range of 1 to 21 days; 98% have an incubation period that falls within the 1 to 42 day interval. WHO is therefore confident that detection of no new cases, with active surveillance in place, throughout this 42-day period means that an Ebola outbreak is indeed over.<ref>http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/ebola/14-october-2014/en/</ref>\n\n=== The New England Journal of Medicine===\n  \nThe mean incubation period was 11.4 days. Time between Exposure and Disease Onset, and did not vary by country. Approximately 95% of the case patients had symptom onset within 21 days after exposure, which is the recommended period for follow-up of contacts. The estimated mean (\u00b1SD) serial interval was 15.3\u00b19.3 days, which is the same as the estimated mean generation time (see Supplementary Appendix 1)<ref>http://www.nejm.org/doi/suppl/10.1056/NEJMoa1411100/suppl_file/nejmoa1411100_appendix1.pdf</ref>.\n\nThe measured duration of the incubation period, and its variation, imply that the advice to follow case contacts for 21 days is appropriate.

A current review of previous outbreaks cites the same range . The precise origin of this assessment is unclear, however it is possibly based on the study of the either the 1976 Zaire outbreak11 or 2000 Uganda outbreak both of which reported (without detailed analysis) a maximum observed incubation time of 21 days.<ref>http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/on-the-quarantine-period-for-ebola-virus/#ref17</ref>\n\nAt a 21 day quarantine period, using the data sets other than the Congo analysis of Chowell, three Congo data analyses, the probability of exceedance is between 1.9 and 12%. In other words from 0.1 to 12% of the time, an individual case will have a greater incubation time than 21 days. The 0.1% stems from the 1976 Zaire outbreak, which has the fewest cases analyzed than any of the others in Figure 2.\nIf the estimated incubation time distributions for the Congo outbreak (Figure 2) are used, this would suggest a quarantine time of as high as 31 days. <ref>http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/on-the-quarantine-period-for-ebola-virus/#ref17</ref>\n\n\n\n[[File:Longincubation.png|frameless|600px|Source: [http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/on-the-quarantine-period-for-ebola-virus/#ref17 PLOS Currents - FIGURE 2.

The particle explosion also sets off an overwhelming inflammatory reaction. That\u2019s what causes the sudden flu-like symptoms that are the first signs of ebola.

The timeline of 300 days is longer than most of the previously recorded outbreaks of EVD or Marburg Virus Disease.\n\nModel Description: Estimate the daily movement of patients using disease probabilities for three (3) different categories of isolation: Hospitalization, Home Isolation, and No Home Isolation. We used probabilities, drawn from reports of previous EVD outbreaks, to model the daily movement of patients between and within the various disease categories (i.e., susceptible, incubation, infectious, revocery/death).\n\nType of Model: Susceptibile, Incubation, Infectious, Recovery (SIIR) Model.\n\nLanguage:\neng \n\n\n== Controversy ==\nA user on reddir.com/r/ebola demonstrated how innacurate the spreadsheet can be by showing results generated by different starting parameters:\n\"This is fiddling with the patient isolation parameters (bar chart at the bottom), holding all other values at their defaults.

By combining two existing technologies\u2014IntraHealth\u2019s iHRIS health workforce information software and UNICEF\u2019s mobile phone SMS platform\u2014we have created a powerful communication tool called mHero. Using mHero, ministries can instantly send critical information to health workers\u2019 mobile phones, including reports of emerging cases, reminders about safety protocols, and reference and training materials.\n|mHero, currently under rapid development, is a free SMS mobile phone-based system designed for communication among Ministry of Health staff, health workers, and community health workers. By supporting the interoperability of human resources information systems, such as IntraHealth\u2019s iHRIS, with UNICEF\u2019s SMS, and utilizing the OpenHIE architecture, the platform can immediately use health workforce data to target specific communications based on cadre, location, and other information. Communications, which can be triggered both centrally and locally, go far beyond traditional \u201cmessage blasts\u201d offered by many technology vendors. Real-time monitoring, complex multipath surveys, monitoring, and detailed analysis can readily be conducted. Further, Interactive Voice Response (IVR) mLearning approaches will take knowledge delivery one step beyond SMS with higher content limits, while also addressing literacy and language divides through spoken language. IntraHealth has developed an Ebola SMS course and an Ebola IVR course, both of which health workers can take using basic mobile phones. \n|\n|2014-09-01\n|2015-09-01\n|\n|UNICEF, USAID, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Jembi Health Systems, Thought Works, and OpenHIE\n|Liberia Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, iLab Liberia\n|[[IntraHealth International]]\n|\n|\n|Guinea,Liberia,Sierra Leone\n|\n|2014-10-22\n|2014-10-22\n|active\n|Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson,UNICEF,U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)\n|----\n|[[Life for Relief and Development]]\n|LRD-SL-14-5161\n|\n|Medical Supplies and Equipment for Hospitals and Clinics (Sierra Leone)\n|Provided hospital beds, medical supplies and equipment for the Ebola holding centers in Sierra Leone and will continue providing ongoing medicines, medical supplies and equipment to hospitals in the region.\n|Sending medicines, medical supplies and equipment to hospitals and clinics in Sierra Leone.\n|\n|2014-04-01\n|2015-12-31\n|1500000\n|\n|\n|\n|200000\n|People of Sierra Leone\n|Sierra Leone&gt;Eastern,Sierra Leone&gt;Northern,Sierra Leone&gt;Southern,Sierra Leone&gt;Western\n|http://www.lifeusa.org\n|2014-05-13\n|2014-10-22\n|active\n|Brother's Brother Foundation,Children of Abraham,Medwish International\n|----\n|[[Stop Hunger Now]]\n|STOP-LR-14-8121\n|\n|Crisis Response with Salesian Missions Liberia - 2014\n|[[Stop Hunger Now]] is supporting the Ebola relief efforts of Salesian Missions by shipping food and medical supplies.

The volunteers, equipped with protective gear and medical equipment, have referred suspected cases to health services, carried out tracing work and provided ebola awareness and counseling to families. Information on the referral pathway (i.e. where to go for different services), telephone numbers and other contact details are posted on village centers and homes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2) Sensitization and education on prevention methods in five districts by volunteers, priests, field project staff community stakeholders through radio and panel discussions and public rallies.

This network is used to get key messages across to a wider population and to provide much needed assistance, such as basic sanitary and hygiene supplies, protective equipment and food, to affected communities.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2) Church leaders' high esteem and respect among communities: They are  listened to, especially during times of crisis. They can build upon the trust and confidence they have with their respective communities to incite positive change and reduce risky behavior and practices. The government has also recognized this level of respect, and have invited both dioceses to sit on the respective government-led response mechanisms, thereby providing access, visibility and authority in high-level decision making bodies. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(3) Strong partnerships with government and civil society organizations:  Our partners are members of the government-led task force units established at national and district levels, enabling them to contribute to the overall effort by sharing information and knowledge and responding in a coordinated, cost-effective manner.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(4) Large, dedicated and skilled volunteer workforce: This includes community malaria agents, priests, women\u2019s micro-savings group leaders, farm group members and others that are major stakeholders in our integrated development programs and who are also key mobilizers in the fight against Ebola.\n\n==See Also==\n[[List of NGO activities]]\n\n[[category:informational]]\n[[category:ngo]]", "title": "Episcopal Relief and Development"}, {"text": "[[category:organizations]]\n\n\n==Recent News==\n\n\n\n\nNew Health Minister rejected - The New Dawn Liberia\n* http://www.thenewdawnliberia.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=13338:new-health-minister-rejected&amp;catid=25:politics&amp;Itemid=59\n* Summary: The Senate took the decision based on the confirmation report from the Health, Gender and Social Welfare Committee headed by former Health Minister, Dr. Peter Coleman now senator of Grand Kru County.", "title": "Health Gender and Social Welfare Committee"}, {"text": "==Disclaimer==\n===Ebola Wiki MAKES NO GUARANTEE OF VALIDITY===\n\nThis is an online open-content collaborative encyclopedia; that is, a voluntary association of individuals and groups working to develop a common resource of human knowledge.

If there were a $100 rapid test for Ebola that could test everyone who has a fever in Liberia (perhaps 5 percent of a population of 10 million people, or 500,000 individuals), it could identify all the cases of Ebola for $50 million and possibly enable a more targeted approach that would put an end to this epidemic much more quickly.\n\n\n\n\nGovernments' responses to the Ebola crisis: correct, knee-jerk reaction or complacency? @ netivist.org\n* https://netivist.org/debate/government-responses-to-ebola\n* Summary: Ever since the epidemic spread to Liberia and Sierra Leone and several outbreaks have ocurred in other African countries.\n\n\n\n\nFirst Human Ebola Vaccine Trial Shows It Seems to Work\n* http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/ebola-virus-outbreak/first-human-ebola-vaccine-trial-shows-it-seems-work-n256196\n* Summary: Ebola is raging through Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea.\n\n\n\n\nNov 14th-17th new cases: Liberia - 62, Sierra Leone - 348, Guinea - 77.

President Ellen Johnson has vowed that Liberia achieves the target of zero cases of Ebola by December 25 and in an attempt to ensure that the target is met, the Government of Liberia through the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare has issued a regulation declaring several practices illegal and warning that violation of measures intended to fight the virus will be punishable under the Public Health Law of Liberia. Two Liberians Patrick Sawyer and Eric Duncan transported the virus to Nigeria and the United States of America respectively raising fears in the international community that if the virus is not curbed, it could become a world problem.

Different Models Yield Different Answers for Liberia\n* http://currents.plos.org/outbreaks/article/is-west-africa-approaching-a-catastrophic-phase-or-is-the-2014-ebola-epidemic-slowing-down-different-models-yield-different-answers-for-liberia/\n* Summary: In parallel, the Liberia national response team has reported that the EBOV outbreak has slowed considerably in recent weeks 10, before the heightened international response kicked in, probably as a result of social distancing measures, patient isolation and changes in funeral practices 5. In the case of the EBOV epidemic in Liberia, our forecasting results based on the logistic growth model support a decline in the effective size of the at-risk susceptible population, a process likely dominated by changes in population behavior and the impact of public health interventions. Importantly, even if our optimistic predictions are correct for Liberia, there are compelling reasons for maintaining existing measures as the vast majority of the population remains immunologically susceptible. The implementation of additional interventions in Liberia, such as US donation of 1,700 hospital beds and influx of international health care workers can only maximize the benefits of existing interventions, relieve an overly strained health infrastructure, and help with the backlog of competing health priorities that have been sidelined by the Ebola outbreak.\n* Source: [[currents.plos.org]] \n\n\n\n\n\nUN News - Ebola: Ban hopeful of outbreak\u2019s end by mid-2015; UN to set up response office in Mali\n* http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=49412#.VG_nEqjTlpU\n* Summary: Earlier today, WHO released its latest report on Ebola cases dated November 18, which put the number of cases at 15,351 cases in Guinea, Liberia, Mali, Sierra Leone, Spain, and the United States and in the previously affected countries of Nigeria and Senegal, with 5,459 reported deaths.\n* Source: [[un.org]] \n\n\n\n\n\nEbola crisis: UN calls out 'acts of discrimination' against West African countries\n* http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-11-22/isolating-ebola-ridden-countries-act-of-discrimination-says-un/5911148\n* Summary: It also expressed concern at \"acts of discrimination against the nationals of Guinea, Liberia, Mali and Sierra Leone\".\n* Source: [[abc.net.au]] \n\n\n\n\n\nEbola: Dr. Fauci of NIH says Dallas hospital should have admitted Duncan right away; \u201ctragic mistake\u201d\n* http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2014/11/ebola-dr-fauci-of-nih-says-dallas-hospital-should-have-admitted-duncan-right-away-tragic-mistake.html/\n* Summary: \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdHe came to the emergency room on a certain day saying that he felt sick, and mentioned that he had come from Liberia.

Since March 2014, the Ebola virus has killed nearly 4,000 people and continues to spread. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control projects the disease could infect as many as 1.4 million people by January 2014, killing up to 70% of those infected, and potentially becoming endemic in West Africa.\n\nBut there is hope. Doctors Without Borders/M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) currently runs five Ebola-management centers with 2000 staff. These courageous individuals are helping stem the tide, but more are urgently needed. The World Health Organization says a 20-fold increase in health care workers is necessary to bring the outbreak under control. The only way that will happen is with support from people like us.\n\nHow It Works\nA Day Without Touch raises much needed funds for MSF while simultaneously raising awareness of the the way Ebola \u201cparasitizes\u201d humanity, using our most human impulses--to touch and care for those who are sick and in need--to propogate disease. Participants are challenged to go for as long as they can without direct skin-to-skin contact while sharing their experiences with friends and family through social media. Please take the A Day Without Touch Challenge today.\n\nI accepted the challenge. Will you?\nWith the help of my family and friends, I will begin the A Day Without Touch Challenge on October 15, 2014. To hear my story, please watch my video diary and follow my progress on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and this blog.\n\nThank you for your support!

It is usually accompanied by early production of infectious virions and elimination of infection by the host immune system. Acute viral infections are typically observed with pathogens such as influenza virus and rhinovirus. Ebola hemorrhagic fever is an acute viral infection, although the course of disease is unusually severe.\n\nOften an acute infection may cause little or no clinical symptoms \u2013 the so-called inapparent infection. A well-known example is poliovirus infection: over 90% are without symptoms. During an inapparent infection, sufficient virus replication occurs in the host to induce antiviral antibodies, but not enough to cause disease. Such infections are important for the spread of infection, because they are not easily detected.\n<ref>http://www.virology.ws/2009/02/13/acute-viral-infections/</ref>\n\n\n== Infection without Symptoms ==\n\nThe CDC's guidelines for testing for Ebola requires that suspected patients have a temperature is at least 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit (or 38.6 degrees Celsius.)<ref>http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/pdf/ebola-algorithm.pdf</ref> If the fever is below this and there are no visible symptoms of Ebola, health authorities say it should be assumed the person is not infectious.\n\nOn October 12, 2014 David Willman of the LA Times wrote an article highlighting a discrepency found by the New England Journal of Medicine.<ref>http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-1012-ebola-fever-20141012-story.html#page=1</ref>, <ref>http://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa1411100</ref>\n\n\"Yet the largest study of the current outbreak found that in nearly 13% of \"confirmed and probable\" cases in Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea and elsewhere, those infected did not have fevers.

In response to a question at the UN press briefing in Geneva, WHO Spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said the December 1 targets for treatment and burials and set by his organization in its response to Ebola would likely be reached in many places, but not in others.\n\n\n\n\nEbola victims\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd bodies left in hospital doorway by protesting burial teams\n* http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/25/ebola-victims-bodies-hospital-doorway-burial-kenema-sierra-leone\n* Summary: Bodies of Ebola victims have been dumped outside a hospital in Sierra Leone by burial workers, who are protesting at the failure of authorities to pay them bonuses for their hazardous work, residents have said. A spokesman for the striking workers in Kenema, who asked not to be identified, said they had not been paid their weekly hazard allowance for seven weeks. Public Services International (PSI), a global trade union federation, has launched a video to name and honour 325 health workers, including doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers and cleaners, who have died of the disease in the three worst-hit countries. Anthony Banbury, head of the UN Mission for Ebola Emergency Response, said on Monday that the target of getting 70% of people with the virus into treatment and 70% of those who die safely buried by 1 December would not be met.\n\n\n\n\nMali confirms 2 new cases of Ebola virus disease\n* http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/ebola/25-november-2014-mali/en/\n* Summary: The first, confirmed on 22 November, occurred in the 23-year-old fianc\ufffd\ufffde of the 25-year-old nurse who attended the Grand Imam from Guinea (the index case in this outbreak) and died of Ebola on 11 November. To date, all 7 cases in this second wave of infections can be linked to contact with an Imam who developed symptoms on 17 October in his native village of Kour\ufffd\ufffdmal\ufffd\ufffd, Guinea, and arrived in Bamako on 25 October for treatment at the Pasteur Clinic. These events ignited additional chains of transmission in Guinea, including several deaths, which are currently under investigation by WHO epidemiologists.

The real test will come if and when the vaccine is used to protect doctors, nurses and other health care workers who treat actual Ebola patients. WHO officials hope to be able to use at least one of the vaccines to start immunizing health care workers by January. The worst side-effect was a brief fever in two volunteers who got a high dose of the vaccine.\n\n\n\n\nHow to ensure safety of vaccines like Ebola when clinical trials are being fast-tracked\n* http://www.pharmaceutical-journal.com/opinion/qa/qa-ensuring-vaccine-safety-is-no-easy-task/20066952.article\n* Summary: The first is to be able to provide technical support every time there is a vaccine safety concern in a country that would require WHO assistance. When risks, even theoretical ones, have been identified, they need to be balanced with the real risks that the Ebola outbreak presents to those who are most vulnerable, such as front-line healthcare and community care workers. There will probably be an accelerated type of phase 2 trial because the vaccines are likely to be offered directly to people who are at risk of the disease. WHO provides advice to UN agencies that purchase vaccines, such as the United Nations Children\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds Fund, to determine the acceptability of vaccines considered for purchase.\n* Source: [[pharmaceutical-journal.com]] \n\n\n\n\n\nPeter Piot's 4 tips to fight Ebola\n* https://www.devex.com/news/peter-piot-s-4-tips-to-fight-ebola-84870\n* Summary: With the Ebola crisis still far from unresolved, Devex spoke to the scientist who helped to discover the Ebola virus almost four decades ago to learn more about what the global development community needs to do right now to tackle the disease.

The guidance also states that although 5 \u00b5m (Micrometers) has traditionally been defined as the particle size break point distinguishing between larger particles (droplet transmission) and smaller particles (airborne transmission), observations of particle dynamics have demonstrated that a range of droplet sizes, including those with diameters of 30 \u03bcm or greater, can remain suspended in the air. Influenza virus is an example of a pathogen transmitted by the droplet route.\n\nThe HICPAC guidance defines airborne transmission as dissemination of either airborne droplet nuclei or small particles in the respirable size range containing infectious agents that remain infective over time and distance. It states that microorganisms carried in this manner may be dispersed over long distances by air currents and may be inhaled by susceptible individuals who have not had face-to-face contact with (or been in the same room with) the infectious individual.\n\nFurthermore, preventing the spread of pathogens by the airborne route requires the use of special air handling and ventilation systems, such as airborne infection isolation rooms (AIIRs) to contain and then safely remove the infectious agents. In addition to AIIRs, respiratory protection with a NIOSH-certified N95 or higher level respirator is recommended for HCP entering the AIIR to prevent acquisition of airborne infectious agents. Mycobacterium tuberculosis is cited as an example of a pathogen transmitted by the airborne route.\n\nIn spite of the distinction made between droplet and airborne transmission, current knowledge of aerosols indicates that there is no clear line differentiating droplet and airborne transmission, as currently defined, on the basis of particle size. Coughing, sneezing, talking, exhalation, and certain medical procedures generate respiratory particles in a wide range of sizes -- not just very large droplets that launch directly to the mucosal surfaces or drop to the floor. In addition, particles begin to evaporate and become smaller immediately upon emission, and particles ranging from very small up to 100 \u03bcm can be inhaled by persons in the near vicinity of the source. <ref>http://img.medscape.com/article/741/245/741245-figure.jpg</ref>\n\nIn the current infection control paradigm, airborne transmission is synonymous with long-range transmission of pathogens that can be inhaled and require special air handling to contain. This contrasts with droplet transmission, in which infectious particles are thought to be deposited on a mucous membrane, are not inhaled, and do not require special air handling. However, the association of droplet exposure with infection is confounded by inhalation exposure because close contact with infectious people permits droplet exposure but also maximizes inhalation exposure. Therefore, it is incorrect to conclude that because long-range transmission of infection is not observed, a pathogen is transmitted only by the droplet route.\n\nAbsence of long-range transmission, as demonstrated for tuberculosis and measles, does not mean that a pathogen cannot be transmitted by inhalation. As currently defined, the terms \"droplet\" and \"airborne transmission\" are inadequate to describe aerosol transmission by inhalation at short range.\n<ref>http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/741245_3</ref>\n\n== Blood ==\n\nAt the peak of illness, an Ebola patient can have 10 billion viral particles in one-fifth of a teaspoon of blood. That compares with 50,000 to 100,000 particles in an untreated H.I.V. patient, and five million to 20 million in someone with untreated hepatitis C. <ref>http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/us/questions-rise-on-preparations-at-hospitals-to-deal-with-ebola.html?_r=1</ref>\n\n== Dogs ==\nDuring the 2001-2002 outbreak in Gabon, [the NHI] observed that several dogs were highly exposed to Ebola virus by eating infected dead animals. To examine whether these animals became infected with Ebola virus, [the NHI] sampled 439 dogs and screened them by Ebola virus-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G assay, antigen detection, and viral polymerase chain reaction amplification. Seven (8.9%) of 79 samples from the 2 main towns, 15 (15.2%) of 99 samples from Mekambo, and 40 (25.2%) of 159 samples from villages in the Ebola virus-epidemic area had detectable Ebola virus-IgG, compared to only 2 (2%) of 102 samples from France. Among dogs from villages with both infected animal carcasses and human cases, seroprevalence was 31.8%. A significant positive direct association existed between seroprevalence and the distances to the Ebola virus-epidemic area. This study suggests that dogs can be infected by Ebola virus and that the putative infection is asymptomatic. <ref>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15757552</ref> However, the CDC reports no current reports of dogs or cats becoming sick with Ebola. <ref>http://www.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola/transmission/qas-pets.html</ref> The World Small Animal Veterinary Assn. recommends that pets exposed to Ebola be quarantined and tested. <ref>http://www.wsava.org/article/ebola-and-dogs</ref>\n\n== Wildlife-to-Human ==\nEbola can infect mammals and likely first spread to humans from bats in rural Africa. <ref>http://time.com/3480961/ebola-animals-transmission/</ref>\n\nIt is thought that fruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are natural Ebola virus hosts. Ebola is introduced into the human population through close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as chimpanzees, gorillas, fruit bats, monkeys, forest antelope and porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest. <ref>http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/</ref>\n\nBush meat is also a source of transmission from animal to human. Consuming the raw meat of infected bats, apes and/or monkeys can lead to wildlife-to-human Transmission. Animals should be handled with gloves and other appropriate protective clothing. Animal products (blood and meat) should be thoroughly cooked before consumption\n<ref>http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs103/en/</ref>\n\nDuring the 2001-2002 outbreak in Gabon, [it was ]observed that several dogs were highly exposed to Ebola virus by eating infected dead animals.

The World Bank had previously pledged $500 million for countries hit by the epidemic, and warned Ebola could sap more than $32 billion from West Africa by the end of 2015 if it spreads beyond Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n* Source: [[uk.reuters.com]]", "title": "World Bank"}, {"text": "[[category:people]]\n\n\n==Recent News==\n\n\n\n\nBulletin of the Atomic Scientists\n* http://thebulletin.org/ebola-slow-motion-atomic-bomb7825\n* Summary: (By comparison, UK researchers\ufffd\ufffdNeil Ferguson and W.

The ruler, arithmetically unaware, quickly accepted the inventor's offer, even getting offended by his perceived notion that the inventor was asking for such a low price, and ordered the treasurer to count and hand over the wheat to the inventor. However, when the treasurer took more than a week to calculate the amount of wheat, the ruler asked him for a reason for his tardiness. The treasurer then gave him the result of the calculation, and explained that it would take more than all the assets of the kingdom to give the inventor the reward.

Founded in 1998, it has mobilized over 450,000 volunteers to send more than 150,000,000 meals to 65 countries.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_Hunger_Now\n\nOur Vision: A world without hunger.\n\nOur Mission: To end hunger in our lifetime by providing food and life-saving aid to the world's most vulnerable and by creating a global commitment to mobilize the necessary resources.\n\nHistory\n\nStop Hunger Now is an international hunger relief agency that has been fulfilling its commitment to end hunger for more than 15 years. Since 1998, the organization has coordinated the distribution of food and other lifesaving aid to children and families in countries all over the world.\n\nStop Hunger Now created its meal packaging program, in 2005. The program perfected the assembly process that combines rice, soy, dehydrated vegetables and a flavoring mix including 21 essential vitamins and minerals into small meal packets. Each meal costs only 29 cents. The food stores easily, has a shelf-life of two years and transports quickly. Stop Hunger Now works with international partners that ship and distribute the meals in-country.\n\nThe packaging operation is mobile enough to go wherever volunteers are located, and can be adapted to accommodate as few as 25 and as many as 500 volunteers at a time. One SHN packaging event can result in the packaging of more than 1,000,000 meals. The use of volunteers for product packaging has resulted in an extremely cost-effective operation while, at the same time, increasing awareness of global hunger and food insecurity issues across the world.\n\nStop Hunger Now provides over 70% of its meals to support transformational development programs such as school feeding programs, vocational training programs, early childhood development programs, orphanages, and medical clinics.  Working with these programs helps enhance lives by giving beneficiaries the opportunity to break the cycle of poverty through education,  skills development, and health care while also receiving much needed nutrition.  Stop Hunger Now\u2019s goal is to allocate 80% of its meals to transformational development programs by 2015.\n\nEvery year Stop Hunger Now reserves 10% of its projected meals to respond right away to crisis situations including natural disasters, conflict and famine.   In addition to providing food for crisis relief, Stop Hunger also works to meet the immediate needs of those suffering from hunger.\n\nStop Hunger Now's meal packaging program operations throughout the US and internationally.  \n\n\n==See Also==\n[[List of NGO activities]]\n\n[[category:informational]]\n[[category:ngo]]", "title": "Stop Hunger Now"}, {"text": "http://www.savethechildren.org\n\nSave the Children Federation, Inc., commonly known as Save the Children USA, is a non-profit organization working to improve the lives of children in the United States of America and around the world.
